## Outline
To create a non-fungibe token marketplace focused on generating funding for worthy humanitarian, enviromental, and generally awesome causes.

## Goals
* Get backend (Smart contracts) and frontend (web interface) up and running on Kovan test network. Important to build solid fondation so we know how everything works and can iron out bugs. We need to know that everything *DOES* work, not that everything *SHOULD* work. 
* Once we have everything up and running smoothly in a test enviroment we can begin to add extra features to smart contracts like profit splitting etc.
* Can look into hosting NFT collections on opensea and other secondary markets
* Develop a more robust and attractive front end
* Make sexy NFT's that people wanna buy
* Form partnerships with charities(?)

## TODO
### Backend
* Deploy smart contracts on Kovan
* Mint a handfull of NFT's
* Learn how to host with IPFS && understand the "./src/backEnd/scripts/nftsData.js" file
* Deploy NFT pics on IPFS

### Frontend
* Understand how the React.js file works
* How to host front end website on interwebs

### Fullstack
* Point frontend at backend and make a full purchase transaction

### Improvments
* Find front end dev to help us build an awesome website that breeds confidence
* Find Digital artist(s) that can make awesome NTF artworks
